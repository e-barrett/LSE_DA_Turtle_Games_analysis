the price at which they should sell particular products (Week 1)
the customer group that will most likely leave a review on the products they’ve purchased (Week 4)
the most popular, expensive products purchased by a particular group of customers (Week 4)
the general sentiment of customers across various products (Week 3)
the sales they can expect to achieve for particular products they offer (Week 5 and 6)
To support Turtle Games' understanding, you may wish to perform analysis across a variety of products to identify insights such as:

Lego sets: Turtle Games sources and sells Lego products across various countries. They want your help with predicting the prices to inform the sales performance. 
Determine the optimal price at which they should sell Lego products based on the number of Lego pieces in the Lego set and the age of the customer that the product is most likely to be purchased by (Week 1).
What price should be set for the Lego sets that have 8,000 Lego pieces?
What price should be set for all the Lego sets that have 8,000 Lego pieces and are most likely to be purchased by customers who are 30 years old?
Determine the customer group that will most likely leave a review on the products they have purchased.
